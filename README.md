Some background information on X-Ray:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X-Ray files allow you to get information on key characters and terms from shelfari. You can do this in one of a few ways.
1. You can highlight the word in question and if the x-ray file has information on it, a popup with a brief description will
	show. It will also show you where this character has been mentioned in the past (will show page number and excerpt where
	mention occurred).
2. You can click X-Ray and search for the word either by looking through the list or using the search bar. Clicking on the word
	will show you the same popup from #1.

Note: X-Ray files work only work on Amazon products such as the Kindle PW. For more information on X-Ray files, see here:

It also has a notable clips section which show quotes from shelfari. If there are not enough shelfari quotes found, the plugin
	will add more random excerpts so there are least 20 notable clips.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	1. Create/Update x-ray files for selected books
	2. Send previously generated x-ray files to device

	Note: Creating an x-ray file using this plugin will automatically search for and use the correct ASIN so you don't need to
		search for it.
	Note: Highlighting words should work but I have not tested with a book that has DRM so I don't know if it will work for them.

Preferences:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	1. Use spoilers when creating x-ray
		- Will create file with shelfari spoilers enabled
	2. Send x-ray to device if connected
		- After creating x-ray file, file will automatically be sent to device
	3. Create x-ray for files that don't already have them when sending to device
		- When sending previously generated x-ray files, x-ray files will be generated for selected books that don't already have
			a file created
	4. Book types to create x-ray files for
		- Selection of formats to consider when creating and sending x-ray files.

Testing:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	This plugin has been tested using a Kindle PW2 on Windows 8 and 10.
	I am still working on testing some portions of it so if you do find a bug or want to request a feature, please let me know via
		Github or Mobileread.
